    <h1>We are a small family-owned business made of family, friends, and members of our community.  We are proud of our cookies, especially since it's an original recipe our very own 6 year old son created one snowy day in 2013.  We fell in love with them and decided we needed to share the cookies with everyone.  We give a portion of the proceeds to the Children's Cancer Research Fund.  We hope you enjoy!</h1>
